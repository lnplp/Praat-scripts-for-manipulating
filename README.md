**insert_silence.script** replaces a selected section of a sound file with white noise at a user-specified amplitude.

**set_interval_duration.script** allows the user to lengthen or shorten a specific Textgrid interval through PSOLA resynthesis; the rest of the file is not adjusted (so lengthens or shortens accordingly).

**set_file_duration_intensity.script** allows the user to lengthen or shorten all soundfiles in a given directory to a target duration through PSOLA resynthesis; average intensity ican be set too.
