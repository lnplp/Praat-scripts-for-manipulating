**insert-silence.script** replaces a selected section of a sound file with white noise at a user-specified amplitude.

**pitch-manipulation.script** creates a manipulation object with a stylized pitch contour for each sound file in a specified directory and brings it up for editing; it also sets the average intensity before saving the output. 

**save-sound.script** is a simple utility script that speeds up writing a selected sound object to a sound file.

**set-interval-duration1.script** allows the user to lengthen or shorten a specific Textgrid interval through PSOLA resynthesis. The script loops through a directory.

**set-interval-duration2.script** allows the user to lengthen or shorten three consecutive Textgrid intervals through PSOLA resynthesis. The script works on one file at a time.

**set-interval-duration3.script** allows the user to lengthen or shorten five consecutive Textgrid intervals through PSOLA resynthesis. The script works on one file at a time.

**set-fileduration-intensity.script** allows the user to lengthen or shorten all soundfiles in a given directory through PSOLA resynthesis; average intensity can be adjusted too.
